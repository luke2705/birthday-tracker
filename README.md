# birthday-tracker
A wonderful app to help me keep track of how old all my nieces and nephews are.

This app uses a React front-end and a Node/Express backend which is connected to a SQL Server database. The front-end uses mock data by default, so it can be run with or without the backend in place. 

To get started, clone this branch, run `npm install` and run `npm start` from the src/web/birthday-tracker-app directory. Additional information can be found in the readme for the individual packages.
